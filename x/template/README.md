# 🧱 Module Template for Cosmos SDK

This module serves as a **template** or **starter kit** for building new Cosmos SDK modules. It provides a complete, minimal, and production-grade structure that demonstrates key Cosmos patterns such as:

- Module registration
- Keeper logic
- Message and query servers
- Genesis state management
- Protobuf and gRPC integration

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This module exists to:

- **Bootstrap development** of new modules with minimal effort
- **Maintain consistency** across custom modules in your chain
- Provide a **reference implementation** of best practices in module design
- Serve as a **scaffold** to clone and rename for new feature modules
