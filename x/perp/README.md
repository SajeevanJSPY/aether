## üßÆ Core Concepts

### üè¶ Margin & Leverage
Users open positions by depositing margin and selecting a leverage factor. The position notional = margin √ó leverage.

### ‚ÜîÔ∏è Long and Short
- Longs profit when the token price rises.
- Shorts profit when the token price falls.

### üí∏ Funding Rate
- Periodic payments exchanged between longs and shorts to keep the perpetual price close to the spot price.
- Funding payments are tracked per position and can be settled or applied over time.

### üíÄ Liquidation
Positions that fall below the maintenance margin ratio are flagged for liquidation to protect the protocol from bad debt.
